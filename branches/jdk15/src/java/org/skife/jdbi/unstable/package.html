    Contains classes and interfaces whose behavior is subject to change within a
    version (1.1.X). Usage of anything under this package should be carefully considered if you
    don't want to have to make any code changes when updating for a bug fix/minor enhancement (1.1.X)
    release.
</p>
<p>
    All that said, there is some powerful stuff here that will be stabilized and moved into
    the normal package space as, is the case in most versions, the correct interface is
    defined for it.

<p>
    If you <i>do</i> find great use in any of these, please let the developers know as we
    will definately take that into account if we can.
