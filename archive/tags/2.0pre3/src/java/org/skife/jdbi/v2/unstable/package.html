<h1>Early Access / In Development Modules</h1>

<p>
    The <code>org.skife.jdbi.v2.unstable</code> package contains modules which
    work but are not yet considered stable, and with APIs which are subject to
    backwards incompatible changes between minor releases.
</p>

<p>
    Once an unstable module has become stable it will generally move out of this
    package, and henceforth will be subject to the normal compatibility contract.
