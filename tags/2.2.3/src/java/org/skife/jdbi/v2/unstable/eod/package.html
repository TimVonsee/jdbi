    JDBC4 was originally supposed to provide a number of AQLJ like "ease of development" features
    which were dropped at the last minute in order to allow the JDBC4 release to coincide
    with JDK 1.6. These interfaces seemed to actually be extremely convenient, so similar
    implementations are provided here. These are <i>not</i> identical to the proposed
    JDBC4 features, but are just based on the ideas therein, and on the ideas in SQLJ.
