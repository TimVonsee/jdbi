Building requires Apache Ant ( http://ant.apache.org/ )

If ant complains that it cannot find the JUnit task, copy
the junit-3.8.1.jar into the $ANT_HOME/lib directory, or into
$HOME/.ant/lib and try again.

To build the runtime library, use "ant jar"

    This will produce a jdbi-<version>.jar in the build/ directory

    There are no library dependencies for jDBI

To run the unit/regression test suite use "ant test"

    Test report will be in the report/ directory

    The test suite requires the libraries in the lib/test/ directory
    and uses the Apache Derby ( http://www.apache.org/ ) embedded
    database for its tests.
